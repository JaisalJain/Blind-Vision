# Blind Vision Backend

The backend for this project runs in a Google Colab/kaggle notebook to leverage its free T4 GPU for model inference.

### Instructions

1.  Once the notebook is open in Colab/Kaggle, make sure to enable the GPU by going to `Runtime > Change runtime type > T4 GPU`.
2.  Follow the steps in the notebook to start the server and generate the `ngrok` URL needed for the frontend.
